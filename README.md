SJTU engineering course project code

The project is aimed to open the door for the roommate in dormitory remotely when you are in busy, such as playing the computer games, doing the homework and so on.

This includes codes of Android App and MSP430.

Use bluetooth to communicate between Android and MSP430. MSP430 accepts the signal and run the motor and servo to open the door.
